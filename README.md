DrAiveX in Danger! 

The President of NSEC ECell and Faculty Advisor of NSEC Ecell, wants atleast 30 students of college, to attend DrAiveX. 
Apart from this..

Being a Security 
enthusiast, the Faculty Advisor, created another constraint that, all the 3rd year and above students of DrAiveX having their a first name or last name in their Email ID should be removed from the group, since it is a case of Mere Irresponsibility,  for a future engineer to do such a thing.

Now the President Of ECell wants, atleast 10% of the attendees to be from Civil(CE) and Mechanical(ME) combined (Stats shows they are people who are most interested in ECell).

Please help us find out, If
 DrAiveX can exist in college, after considering all these Towering Constraints.

Your prediction can help us, save the future of NSEC, in the field of AI.
